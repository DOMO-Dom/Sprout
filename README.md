**THE PROBLEM**

## INTRODUCTION

Does one ever feel like they are drifting through life but not moving any closer to being the person they imagine to be? It usually happens around the beginning of the year. They envision all the terrible habit they will be able to break free or acquire for an improved lifestyle. We have all been in this seemingly unbreakable horrible habit and wanted to make the change.

What is Habit? According to Duke University studies, habit account for nearly 40% of one's daily behavior. When we first see that number, it is a little surprising. For over half of the day, our behavior is on autopilot, thanks to habit.

**	**Habit, what does it mean? The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines habit as "an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary" (Habit Definition & Meaning, n.d.).

According to Atomic Habits author James Clear, "habit are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day"(Clear, 2018). G. Walesh defines a habit as "Involuntary actions that the subconscious mind controls. The habit area includes our thoughts, words, and general activities. Imagine a driver driving their car a few blocks and suddenly realizing they could not recall doing so? Their driving was largely habit, and their subconscious mind was "at the wheel" (Martin, n.d.).

We have learned that as a simple way of dealing with boredom and stress, we acquire undesirable behaviors known as poor habit. Of course, sometimes, the visible stress or boredom results from underlying issues. These are challenging issues to contemplate, but if people are sincere about making changes, they must be honest with themselves. The problem in breaking poor habit is the commitment, management, and tracking toward eliminating poor habit and forming new good habit by following a routine.

**	**The intent of the study is to create a system that is centered on dealing with poor habit that are affecting the users [Health, Lifestyle, Connection, Addiction, Stress, etc] and wanting to make a change by following the carefully selected and suggested routines that will help improve the users commitment for change.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND METHODOLOGY

## RELATED LITERATURE (Simple Past / Past Perfect)

As we grow older, we develop habit without us even noticing it. Habits play an important role in our daily life. We all develop various habit. A habit is simply a habitually repeated behavior. You do it without giving it much thought. Sometimes you set out to form a habit, but most of the time they form without your knowledge. You get through each day by employing a series of habit, many of which you may be unaware of.
According to the World of Work Project (2017), habit are tasks or behaviors that we perform almost subconsciously. They are the body’s way of automating repeated tasks, freeing the mind to focus on higher level activities. Habits are defined as routines that are followed on a regular basis. They can also be defined as actions that result from an internal or external trigger (Robbins & Costa, 2017). It is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly and, in many cases, automatically. Either good or bad, people develop habit that are considered bad for their health and surroundings. The problem is that our brains work to turn our everyday interactions into habit and routines which is why some people find it difficult to give up unhealthy habit. According to Jaffe (2019), it is hard to break a habit. Patterns emerge over time, both in behavior and in the brain. This can make breaking a habit extremely difficult. MIT researchers discovered that if neurons fire at the beginning and end of a

specific behavior, it becomes a habit. The primary core that works to help people develop habit causing the automatic actions is the basal ganglia (Graybiel, n.d. as cited in Jaffe, 2019) which is known to control voluntary movements which is the same region that helps people develop unwanted and unhealthy habit.

According to Milkman (n.d. as cited in Knowable Magazine, 2021), habit are like shortcuts - they're things we can do quickly and without thinking because we've done them so many times that they've become automatic. Habits are built through learning and repetition.Our brains are constantly bombarded with stimuli designed to make us crave and consume, stimuli that hijack the reward-based learning system in our brains that was designed for survival in the first place. Reward-based learning involves a trigger (for example, the sensation of hunger), a behavior (eating food), and a reward (feeling sated) (Brewer, 2019). It seems that we want to do more of what makes us happy and less of what makes us sad.

MIT researchers discovered a simple neurological loop at the heart of every habit, a loop comprised of three components: a cue, a routine, and a reward (Charles Duhigg, n.d.). These three components appear whenever we engage in an activity, such as smoking a cigarette, eating, or checking our newsfeed when we are stressed. Every time we reach for something to calm ourselves, we reinforce the learning until it becomes automatic. This is how habit develop. The brain does not have to work as hard when a habit is formed. You switch to autopilot mode. You learn to link the trigger, behavior, and reward, but you don't always connect the long-term consequences. You may discover that smoking a cigarette relieves your stress, and you may continue to do so until it becomes an automatic response. Unfortunately, once you get into the habit, it’s difficult to break it

There are certain negative effects of developing bad habit. It disrupts your life and keep you from achieving your goals (James Clear, n.d.). They endanger both mental and physical health. And they also waste time and energy.

Understanding the biology of how we develop routines that may be harmful to us, and how to break those routines and embrace new ones, could help us change our lifestyles and adopt healthier behaviors (Volkow, n.d. as cited in National Institute of Health, 2012). A person may be unaware of how her habit works - habit are designed to make things happen without us having to think about them too much. Consciously intervening in one's own habitual behavior is unlikely to come naturally, so breaking a habit may usually require some thought and effort. You must rewire your brain in order to break a bad habit. You can use your brain's rewards system to switch your response to stimuli from those with negative consequences to those with positive ones.

## OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS (Simple Past / Past Perfect)

## //**IMPORTANT**//

**	**MUST CLARIFY THE FOLLOWING:

HABIT, an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary as there is little to no conscious thought on a behavior.

BAD HABIT, also known as bad habit and undesirable behavioral tendencies. Procrastination, overthinking, and nail-biting,  are some of the examples.

ROUTINE, a behavior that is frequently repeated with conscious thought and an intent on doing the task.

BUSTER, to break, destroy, stop poor habit.
