72: Section 4.9: Single TextView with two diferent colors

Colored text can be created by passing the text and a font color name to the following function:

``` private String getColoredSpanned(String text, String color) { String input = "" + text + ""; return input; }```

The colored text can then be set to a TextView (or even to a Button, EditText, etc.) by using the example code
below.

First, define a TextView as follows:

```TextView txtView = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.txtView);
Then, create differently colored text and assign it to strings:
String name = getColoredSpanned("Hiren", "#800000");
String surName = getColoredSpanned("Patel","#000080");
Finally, set the two differently colored strings to the TextView:
txtView.setText(Html.fromHtml(name+" "+surName));
```
